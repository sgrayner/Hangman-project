## Hangman-project

# Description
The purpose of this project is for me to practise the skills I have learnt in python programming techniques, using the command line and github. The task is to create a hangman game. The computer chooses a word. The user inputs letters to guess the word.

# Installation instructions
The program runs on python, the modules imported are the string and random modules.

# Usage instructions
The program asks the user to input a letter. Type in a letter and press enter. The program will then tell the user whether or not the letter is in the word.
